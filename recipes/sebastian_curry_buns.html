                <li>2 cubes Curry Roux</li>
                <li>1 tbsp Tomato Paste</li>
                <li>1 cup of Cooking wine</li>
                <li>1 cup of water</li>
                <li>1 cup of Beef Broth</li>
                <li>Cooking Chocolate</li>

                <p><em>For the Dough:</em></p>
                <li>2 cups bread flour</li>
                <li>1/4 cup cake flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon yeast</li>
                <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
                <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                <li>3 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 egg (beaten)</li>
                <li>Panko Bread crumbs</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by preparing the dough. Activate your yeast in your 1/2 cup of warm water and combine your dry ingredients in a mixer. Afterwards, keep mixing and add in your activated yeast, eggs, and remaining water. Once the dough has kneaded, set it to rest in a container with a damp towel above to let the dough rise.</li>
            <li>Move on to the Curry. Slice up your onions, carrots, mushrooms, and mince your ginger and garlic. We are using beef chunks as well for the meat - however many curries are totally vegetarian so the meat here is optional.</li>
            <li>Oil your pan then brown and soften your onions on a medium high heat before adding in your ginger, garlic, curry powder, and tomato paste. Continue to saute and mix the entire mixture. Then add in your beef with a cup of red wine. Allow this to cook through on a lower temperature.</li>
            <li>When the beef is about half cooked, add in your beef broth and water and bring the entire mixture to a boil. Skim off the scum off the top, then add in your potatoes, carrots, and mushrooms. Cook until your potatoes are soft. Since we'll be putting this curry inside a bun, use a large wooden spoon to mash the ingredients together so the mixture as a whole becomes more smooth.</li>
            <li>To get that final curry flavor, add in your Japanese curry roux, cooking chocolate, garam masala, and cayenne pepper. Set your curry aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Now that our dough has risen, let's prepare our curry buns for deep frying. Bring a pot of oil to 325 degrees. Take out your dough and punch it down. Then knead several times before separating it into smaller chunks. Take a small chunk in your bottom hand and cup it with your free hand. Pushing the dough together from bottom and top, move in a circular motion until you have a spherical ball.</li>
            <li>Roll out your dough, working around the dough bit by bit, until you have a flat circle shape. Hold the dough in your free hand and load a small amount of curry in the middle. Pulling the edge up towards the middle and top of the bun, grab the next edge of the bun and fold it over behind your current fold. Press these edges together so that it is airtight.</li>
            <li>When you've worked your way around the whole bun and have sealed it. Press it carefully against the cutting board to flatten both sides out and fully encapsulate the curry inside.
            </li>
            <li>Dip your loaded buns in an eggwash and then coat it your bread crumbs. Carefully put these into the hot oil and allow them to cook until it becomes a golden brown all around. Once done, remove the curry buns from the fryer and onto a paper towel to remove any extra oil.</li>
        </ol>
