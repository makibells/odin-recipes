            <li>1 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>10 pieces of king oyster mushroom, finely chopped</li>
            <li>8 pieces Swiss brown mushroom, finely chopped</li>

            <li>3 sprigs of rosemary</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>Butcher’s twine</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>White pepper to taste</li>

            <p><em> Sauce:</em></p>
            <li>1 cup red wine</li>
            <li>4 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon soy sauce </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan, sweat the onions and mushrooms with two tablespoons of butter. Season to taste. Reserve and set aside.</li>

            <li>Boil potatoes in salted water until they are soft. </li>
                
            <li>Remove the potatoes and add them to the reserved mushroom mixture, along with the rest of the butter while mashing finely.</li>
                
            <li>Mould the potato and mushroom mixture into a large oblong ball.</li>
                
            <li>In a baking tray, lay across the butcher twine and bacon. Place the potato ball in the middle and wrap over with the rest of the twine and bacon. </li>
                
            <li>Slot the rosemary between the twine and potato ball. </li>
                
            <li>Bake at 220 degrees Celsius for 20 to 25 minutes. The dish is ready when the bacon is brown and fully cooked. </li>
                
            <li>To prepare the sauce, cook the red wine until its volume has reduced to half. </li>
                
            <li>Add in the soy sauce, salt and pepper, and stir well. </li>
                
            <li>Just before serving, stir in the butter and mix well. </li>
                
                <li>To serve, snip the butcher’s twine off the pork roast and pour the sauce over. </li>
                
                    <li>Serve immediately. </li>
        </ol>
