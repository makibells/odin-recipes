        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Let's admit it, watching Sophie make breakfast had us all drooling for some bacon and eggs.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 slices thick cut bacon</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 loaf bread</li>
            <li>1 slab cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add 3 slices of bacon to the pan and cook until crispy. Push them to one side of the pan.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Crack 4 eggs directly into the pan next to the bacon. Cook until sunny side up eggs are to your preference.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat.</li>
            <li>Cut desired amount off from the loaf of bread.</li>
            <li>Serve the bacon, eggs, bread, and cheese family-style.</li>
        </ol>
